#[Project #1: Tunify] (https://github.com/girumyay/cs100final.git)
I, along with three other partners, created an app similar to Spotify that had these features: 
  user will input their music perferences (i.e. artist, songs, genre, subgenre) and a generated list of song recomendtions will output
  a filtering system where the user can filter out certain artists or genre from their recommendation.
  user can create a playlist where thay can add songs, delete songs, and rename playlist.
  user can access information about songs (i.e. song title, song length, artist, album)
